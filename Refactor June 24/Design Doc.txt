    Multiple player characters 
    Ranged attacks/multiple attack/action options
        Dashing
        Shoving

        Prone
    Procedurally generated cavern/dungeon map

    //Borderline
    Non interactable furniture/objects
    Tile system overhaul
        combine lightmap, sightmap, displaygrid, and grid into a grid of objects of class "tile"
        use new grid to handle checks of where characters, uiobjects, and other gameobjects/items are located

Beta Features - after receiving feedback from first round of playtesting (2-4 weeks) (11/12-12/3)
    Interactable furniture/objects
    //End borderline
    Come to decision about HTML canvas vs text display
    Lighting overhaul enabling transparency/partial shadows - possibly address wall problems with directional illumination
    Inventories and items with statistical effects
    Basic player character level-up system
    3rd area type and beyond (ruins, crypts, animal dens, goblin gardens/hunting grounds/fishing spots)
    Environmental hazards such as fire and toxic gas (scholar class?)
    Enemy morale system and fleeing behavior
    Stealth overhaul involving new ways to be discovered (IE sound and torchlight) and new ways to hide (IE darkness and stealth mode)
    Resting system to restore HP

MVP (point at which I could choose to start work on something else) (2-4 weeks for features + unknown logistics/distribution lagtime)
    Save and load system
    Game beginning and end + main menu
    Graphical overhaul to support being played on any machine
    Double check licensing of font/potentially create or commission a custom font/tileset
    Codebase overhaul to allow game to run as standalone executable or be hosted on a website
    Added to a personal website of my own that acts as a portfolio

Branching Future Features (after I have a game, diretions I could go to expand it out after 1.0 is public)
    Multiple levels that have different kinds of areas generated
    Minimalist story involving short bits of text from the party
        Little bits of poetry or dialogue during rest sequences to humanize the ascii art party
        Darkest Dungeon style barks during combat
        Brief yet evocative descriptions of items, objects, and characters
    Address the question of saving/permadeath
        Permadeath with short runs ala spelunky
        Permadeath with long runs ala nethack
        Saves with the intention of only playing the game once or twice
        Unlocks between runs adding more content in future playthroughs ala rogue legacy
        Options for permadeath or traditional rpg style saves ala caves of qud
        Lots of options!!!!
    Non-combat encounters such as merchants
    Non-cave environments such as towns
    Over-arching storylines like Baldur's gate
    Macro strategy for a larger campaign ala darkest dungeon
    Deal with the question of verticality
        This would probably entail some kind of hybrid between the pure 2d of traditional roguelikes
        And the horizontal slice method of Dwarf Fortress
        One simple way to do it would be just take into account elevation for an otherwise flat grid.
        This would result in a kind of topological map where A can be higher than B, but A is not atop B.

                Enemies can spawn asleep or idling (maybe even unarmed)
                Become suspicious when they hear a noise meaning they're no longer surprisable (this is when they would arm)
